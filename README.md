## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ben Maharjan and I am a motivated junior fullstack developer transitioning
from a successful career as a business owner. After selling
my business, I am eager to persue my dream career as a 
software developer and have recently completed an
intensive coding bootcamp, gaining proficiency in both
front-end and back-end development. I am passionate
about creating practical, efficient, user-friendly
applications and eager to contribute throughout the
development lifecycle.
